gestureSimulator
================

Data of the web app called GestureSimulator that have arisen in the context of my master thesis.

The thesis was written at the Hochschule Fulda - University of Applied Sciences (Germany) in cooperation with the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen (Germany).

GestureSimulator is an application with which it is possible to implement the identified and evaluated static anesthesia gestures of the study technically with the leap motion(TM) controller. The simulation mode allows to testing the gestures. In this case the time between call and recognition of gestures is measured.

Let me know if there are problems. I will appreciate about your feedback.
